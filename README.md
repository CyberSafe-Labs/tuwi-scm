# tuwi-scm

> The goal of the Tuwi project is to create a developer centric network for code hosting, collaboration, and archival.
> One that is community operated, privacy respecting, and completely open source.

*This project is under heavy development. Changes may cause compatibility issues with previous versions.*

### About

Tuwi builds on top of the libp2p and IPFS projects to provide a decentralized code hosting network.
Decentralized networks shift the power from service providers to the users in the form of data ownership.

Data ownership and data portability are the two core factors that will drive innovation on the Tuwi network.
Switching service providers is completely transparent as none of your data is trapped behind a walled garden.

### Features

- Self host your repositories. No server setup required.
- Internet connection optional. Works on your local area network.
- Private by default. Remain anonymous or use a custom handle.

### Getting Started
